# books_library
A React task to show components interaction, acrhitecture etc. (again) 

The task is to write a simple webpage in React that shows a list of books - data is provided via an Ajax Request, that returns a JSON object. 
Note: not a real server is needed here, the ajax calls will return JSON files. However, you will need to use http-server work to return the JSON. 
Each book will have: 
1.	Author 
2.	Date 
3.	Title 
When you enter the page, an AJAX request should fetch a list of books from a json file. 
The page will show all the books resolved from the requests with a proper design – nice design – high score.
